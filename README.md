This project predicts the Air Quality Index (AQI) using a Random Forest Regressor, with data from various pollutants like PM2.5, NO2, and SO2. It includes a Flask-based web application that allows users to input air quality data and get AQI predictions, along with categorization into different air quality bands. The code provides a simple development server for demonstration and can be extended with advanced models and production-grade deployment.
